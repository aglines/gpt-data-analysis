    "- It DOES notice that 'previous_outcome' has nulls\n",

    "    Column 'previous_outcome': Outcome of the previous marketing campaign. It appears to be either NaN (missing value)\n",
    "    or a numerical value (0 or 1). We might need further clarification on this.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Why do you think there is no data for that one column?  What could be the reason?\n",
    "\n",
    "``` \n",
    "    The column with missing data is previous_outcome. There could be several reasons for the missing data:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Data Collection Issues: The data might not have been recorded or might have been lost during data collection.\n",
    "    2. Intentional Omission: The missing values might indicate clients who were never part of a previous campaign, so there's no \"previous outcome\" to record.\n",
    "    3. Data Integration: If the dataset is a result of merging multiple sources, some sources might not have had the previous_outcome column, leading to missing values.\n",
    "    4. Errors in Data Entry: Human error during data entry can result in missing values.\n",
    "    5. System Limitations: Sometimes, certain systems or devices might fail to record specific data due to technical glitches.\n",
    "``` \n",
    "\n",
    "- How do you recommend we handle this missing data?    \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "    1. Imputation:\n",
    "        Mean/Median/Mode: Replace missing values with the mean (for continuous data) or the mode (for categorical data). This might not be applicable here since previous_outcome seems to be binary.\n",
    "        Predictive Model: Use machine learning models to predict and fill missing values based on other columns.\n",
    "        Forward/Backward Fill: Use the previous or next row's value to fill the missing value. This is more useful for time series data.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. Deletion:\n",
    "        Listwise Deletion: Remove all rows with missing values. This is not recommended if a significant number of rows have missing values, as it can result in a loss of data.\n",
    "        Pairwise Deletion: Only remove specific data points that have missing values and use the remaining data.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. Replacement:\n",
    "        Replace with a Specific Value: If we know that the missing value indicates something specific (like \"not part of a previous campaign\"), we can replace the missing value with a specific value, like 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "    4. Leave It: Sometimes, it might be best to leave the missing data as is, especially if the analysis can handle missing values or if the missing data is random and doesn't introduce bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "    For this dataset, given the context, it seems that the missing values in the previous_outcome column might indicate clients who were never part of a previous campaign. In such a case, it would make sense to replace the missing values with a specific value (like 0), especially if 0 indicates \"no success in the previous campaign\" and 1 indicates \"success in the previous campaign\". However, before making such decisions, it's essential to understand the business context and consult domain experts or refer to dataset documentation.\n",
