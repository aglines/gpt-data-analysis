    "        You are an autoregressive language model, fine tuned with instruction tuning and RLHF. You carefully provide accurate, factual, thoughtful, nuanced answers and are brilliant at reasoning. ...\n",
    "\n",
    "        Your users are experts in data analysis, so for basic concepts (such as nulls, ID columns, errors in data collection, etc) be extremely concise. Instead, broaden your reasoning. For every data column, consider its name and how it might relate to other columns, especially if their names are similar or if the data they represent is causally linked. Include this reasoning in your responses. ...\n",

    "```\n",
    "    - contact & contact_duration: The mode of contact could influence the duration. For instance, cellular calls might last longer than telephone calls.  ...\n",
    "    - previous_campaign_contacts & previous_outcome: These could be causally linked; higher previous contacts might lead to a positive previous outcome.\n",
    "    - campaign_outcome & previous_outcome: Past outcomes could influence current outcomes, though the 'previous_outcome' has many missing values.\n",
    "    - campaign_id: Seems redundant as it has only one value, which doesn't add any information.\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "    The dataset likely pertains to some marketing or outreach campaign, where various attributes related to client interaction are recorded. The goal could be to analyze the success rate ('campaign_outcome') in relation to other variables.​​\n",

    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "    The previous_outcome column has a significant amount of missing data; only 5,625 out of 41,188 rows contain values. This could be due to several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "        1. Data Collection Issue: The data might not have been collected for all clients.\n",
    "        2. Conditional Recording: The column might be populated only when certain conditions are met, such as when there was a previous campaign involving the client.\n",
    "        3. Data Loss: Sometimes data can be lost during the merging or transformation process.\n",
    "```\n",
    "__________________\n",
    "#### Prompt: \"How do you recommend we handle this missing data?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "    The strategy for handling this missing data largely depends on the business context and the importance of this column in your analysis. Here are some general approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "        1. Ignore: If the column is not critical for your analysis, you could simply ignore it.\n",
    "        2. Imputation:\n",
    "\n",
    "        - Mean/Median: For a general placeholder, though this doesn't make much sense for a binary outcome column.\n",
    "        - Predictive Models: Use other columns to predict the missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "        1. Flag & Replace: Replace the missing values with a new category (e.g., '-1') and treat it as a separate category during analysis. This is often useful when the absence of data is informative.\n",
    "        2. Delete Rows: Remove rows where this column is missing. This could be risky as it could introduce bias.\n",
    "        3. Backfill or Forward Fill: In time-series data, this could be an option, but likely not applicable here.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Given that previous_outcome might be causally linked to previous_campaign_contacts, one potential approach could be to use predictive imputation based on other columns, particularly previous_campaign_contacts. Alternatively, if the missing value essentially means \"no previous campaign,\" then replacing with '0' (indicating 'no success in a previous campaign') could be justifiable.\n",
    "\n",
    "    So, the best approach would depend on the context and what exactly this missing data represents. If the absence of data is informative (e.g., it means there was no previous campaign for that client), then flagging and replacing might be the most appropriate method.\n",
