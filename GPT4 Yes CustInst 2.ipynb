    "    - `contact` and `contact_duration` are directly related; the method of contact could influence the duration.\n",
    "    - `number_contacts` and `previous_campaign_contacts` share a similar naming scheme and likely represent counts before and during the current campaign. They might be causally linked; for instance, frequent past contacts could influence the number of contacts in the current campaign.\n",
    "    - `pdays` and `previous_outcome` are related to previous campaigns, and their values could influence the `campaign_outcome`.\n",
    "    - `campaign_outcome` is likely the target variable if this dataset is used for predictive modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Given your expertise in data analysis, it might be interesting to look for correlations between columns, especially those that appear causally linked. For example, does a high number of `previous_campaign_contacts` positively correlate with a 'yes' in `campaign_outcome`?\n",

    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "    To look for causal correlations, it's essential to first identify the target variable, which in this context appears to be campaign_outcome. Causal inference is a complex topic, and usually requires experimental or quasi-experimental data to draw definitive conclusions. However, observational data like this can offer some insights when analyzed carefully.\n",

    "    4. previous_outcome: If this represents the outcome of previous campaigns, it could be a strong predictor for the current campaign's outcome. However, this column has many nulls, which need to be handled carefully.\n",

    "    From the initial data exploration, it appears that the column with significant null values is previous_outcome, not the target variable campaign_outcome. \n",
    "    ...\n",
    "\n",
    "    Reasoning:  Relation with previous_campaign_contacts: If the nulls in previous_outcome correspond to zero or low values in previous_campaign_contacts, it might indicate that these clients were not contacted in previous campaigns, justifying the nulls.\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "\n",
    "    Conclusions:  The null values in previous_outcome likely indicate that those clients were not contacted in previous campaigns, corroborated by the fact that previous_campaign_contacts is zero for those entries.\n",

    "    Indicator Variable: Add a binary variable to indicate whether previous_outcome is missing. This would capture the information that the client had no prior contacts, which seems to be the case here.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Recommendations: Given the strong relationship between previous_outcome null values and previous_campaign_contacts, an Indicator Variable or Categorization seems most appropriate. This would capture the nuance that these clients were not previously contacted, which appears to be meaningful in the context of campaign_outcome.\n",
